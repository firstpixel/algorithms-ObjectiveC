# algorithms-ObjectiveC
A few algorithms in Objective C I did just to study

Stack and Queue - Just few tests using NSMutableArray as Stack and Queue
Anagram - Anagram tests, find matching anagram words and return array of it ordered by array and word list.
ArraySum - Array sum, find some of 2 values passing a value
Array - Array shifting left and right
Rectangle - Given a list of rectangles, find the square, rectange and polygonon
String - String test, given a list of words, find the order for first letter matching last letter of another word so allword match.
Dijkstra algorithms - A simplified version of Dijkstra algorithms to find shortest path on a given graph with different weight between places.
